# testForPTM

Field in this app presented as a table of divs or a 2d matrix of divs( hope that I'm correct in this definition ).<br/>
Searching function operate with indexes of cells and their rows.<br/>
To "delete" a cell I'm using a css property "visibility" with value "hidden", so cell will be hidden but it's place in a field will be saved.
